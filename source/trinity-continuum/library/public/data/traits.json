            "description": "Intellect covers the raw computing power of a character's brain. Intellect is used for deduction, problem-solving, and processing information. Anyaction where a character is actively trying to figure out something is usually Intellect based. Characters who frequently use Intellect are scientists, researchers, programmers, tacticians, and librarians. A character with a low Intellect isn't necessarily stupid, though they don't learn as quickly. A high Intellect does not necessarily mean the character is well educated, though they often are.  \n\nIntellect can be used to: recall specific facts, calculate the trajectory of an object, determine how to fix a broken machine, find food and water in the wilderness, or hack a computer. It is important when crafting anything from engines to computer viruses.",

A person with high Cunning thinks on his feet, notices details quickly, and comes up with responses before the others. Cunning is similar to Dexterity in that it covers actions that require speed over force. However, Cunning covers the fine motor skills instead of gross movement. Characters that need high Cunning include investigators, snipers, thieves, law-enforcement officials, and pilots. A character with a low Cunning may be the sort of person who “has their head in the clouds” or can't multi-task. A high Cunning character is very aware of her surroundings and can act without hesitation.  \n\nCunning can be used to: hack computers, notice clues, spot a hidden enemy, understand a political situation, solve riddles, apply emergency medical care, act, con, get away from pursuers in a chase, or solve a maze.",

Characters who need a high Resolve are lawyers, teachers, detectives, or spies. Low Resolve characters are easily fooled and lack mental focus. A character with a high Resolve doesn't miss deadlines, ignores distractions, and is difficult to hypnotize.  \n\nResolve may be used to: study evidence, search archives, move silently, follow animal tracks, resist persuasion, stunt drive, understand scientific theories, stay strong under pressure, or remain focused.",

A high Might score is useful for characters who engage in handto-hand combat on a regular basis, such as police officers, professional boxers, soldiers, and criminal thugs. It is also useful for athletes, from power lifters to baseball players: anywhere where the application of physical force is necessary. A character with a low Might may have suffered an injury so they can\u2019t use their strength without harming themselves further. A character with a high Might may be strong or simply very good at using what strength they do have to maximum effect.  \n\nMight can be used to: forge a sword, lift or throw objects, intimidate, climb walls, or muscle through pain.",

While Might determines how much a character can lift, Dexterity determines how well they can maneuver, either themselves or other objects. A character with a high Dexterity is more likely to catch a ball, walk a tightrope, or dive for cover. Dexterity is useful for acrobats as well as sports where precision is important. A baseball pitcher needs Might to determine the speed of his fastball, but whether or not he keeps it in the strike zone is based on Dexterity. A low Dexterity character may be slow and clumsy. High Dexterity characters are nimble and have good hand-eye coordination.  \n\nDexterity can be used to: jump between buildings, pick a lock, dance, walk over treacherous ground, maintain balance, impress people, or dog fight (in an airplane).",

A high Stamina score is useful for fighters, endurance runners, and medical practitioners who need to avoid getting sick when surrounded by the diseased. A person with low Stamina is often sick or easily injured. A person with a high Stamina has a great resistance and rarely becomes ill.  \n\nStamina can be used to: run long distances, continue in a fight despite injury, recover faster, meditate, or resist diseases or poison.",

Characters who require a high Presence would be salesmen, lawyers, or CEOs. A low Presence character may be shy or unskilled in social situations.

However, some characters can have an astonishing amount of knowledge in the humanities without ever taking a formal class or setting a foot on campus, and many extremely educated people with degrees in science or engineering may still have a low score in Humanities, as they are uninterested in these topics.
