            "description": "Might is raw physical power. It covers lifting or moving heavy objects, including the character themselves. While some fighting styles may require skill and speed over brute strength, a simple punch in the nose requires Might behind it. A high Might score is useful for characters who engage in handto-hand combat on a regular basis, such as police officers, professional boxers, soldiers, and criminal thugs. It is also useful for athletes, from power lifters to baseball players: anywhere where the application of physical force is necessary. A character with a low Might may have suffered an injury so they can\u2019t use their strength without harming themselves further. A character with a high Might may be strong or simply very good at using what strength they do have to maximum effect.  \n\nMight can be used to: forge a sword, lift or throw objects, intimidate, climb walls, or muscle through pain.\n\n|  |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| * | Weak as a kitten. |\n| ** | You aren\u2019t much help when people move. |\n| *** | You go to the gym pretty regularly. |\n| **** | Professional bodybuilder or athlete. |\n| ***** | Olympic-level weightlifter. |\n| ****** | World-record holder, you are quite possibly the strongest person in the world. |",
